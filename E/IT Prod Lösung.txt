Dear Sir or Madam

RECLAMATION OF A DEFECT PRINTER

I have bought a printer 2 Months ago on September the 15th. Two weeks after the purchase, the printer has a major issue:
Every time I print, there are black, horizontal lines over the printed document. Moreover, the black toner is leaking.
If you have an idea, what causes this, please let me know. Beeing purchased 2 months ago, the printer still has warranty.
Should I send the printer to you for repair or is it possible to fix the printer at my place?

I am looking forward to hear from you.


Yours faithfully


Judith Eichner
